Today is a huge day for .NET! We’re happy to announce that .NET Core will be open source, including the runtime as well as the framework libraries.

This is a natural progression of our open source efforts, which already covers the managed compilers (C#, VB, and F#) as well as ASP.NET:

    C# & Visual Basic (“Roslyn”)
    Visual F# Tools
    ASP.NET 5
    Entity Framework

This takes it to the next level by extending it to the .NET runtime and the core framework.

What is .NET Core?

.NET Core is a modular development stack that is the foundation of all future .NET platforms It’s already used by ASP.NET 5 and .NET Native. I’ll go into more detail on what NET Core is and how it relates to the NET Framework in a following blog post.

Why do we open source .NET Core?

There are two big reasons why we decided to open source .NET Core:

    Lay the foundation for a cross platform .NET
    Build and leverage a stronger ecosystem

.NET Core 2.0 is available today as a final release. You can start developing with it at the command line, in your favorite text editor, in Visual Studio 2017 15.3, Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio for Mac. It is ready for production workloads, on your own hardware or your favorite cloud, like Microsoft Azure.

We are also releasing ASP.NET Core 2.0 and Entity Framework Core 2.0. Read the ASP.NET Core 2.0 and the Entity Framework Core 2.0 announcements for details. You can also watch the launch video on Channel 9 to see many of the new features in action.

The .NET Standard 2.0 spec is complete, finalized at the same time as .NET Core 2.0. .NET Standard is a key effort to improve code sharing and to make the APIs available in each .NET implementation more consistent. .NET Standard 2.0 more than doubles that set of APIs that you have available for your projects.

.NET Core 2.0 has been deployed to Azure Web Apps. It is now available in all Azure regions.
