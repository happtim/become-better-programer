Today, we’re announcing that the next release after .NET Core 3.0 will be .NET 5. This will be the next big release in the .NET family.

There will be just one .NET going forward, and you will be able to use it to target Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, tvOS, watchOS and WebAssembly and more.

We will introduce new .NET APIs, runtime capabilities and language features as part of .NET 5.

From the inception of the .NET Core project, we’ve added around fifty thousand .NET Framework APIs to the platform. .NET Core 3.0 closes much of the remaining capability gap with .NET Framework 4.8, enabling Windows Forms, WPF and Entity Framework 6. .NET 5 builds on this work, taking .NET Core and the best of Mono to create a single platform that you can use for all your modern .NET code.

We intend to release .NET 5 in November 2020, with the first preview available in the first half of 2020. It will be supported with future updates to Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio Code.


.NET 5 is the next step forward with .NET Core. The project aims to improve .NET in a few key ways:

* Produce a single .NET runtime and framework that can be used everywhere and that has uniform runtime behaviors and developer experiences.
* Expand the capabilities of .NET by taking the best of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin and Mono.
* Build that product out of a single code-base that developers (Microsoft and the community) can work on and expand together and that improves all scenarios.
